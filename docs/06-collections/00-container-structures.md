# Collections of Data

C++ provides built-in data structures for storing and processing collections of data.

## Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Describe the purpose of namespaces in relation to variable scope.
- Make use of built-in types defined in existing namespaces.
- Define custom namespaces.
- Store and access data of a uniform type in standard arrays and vectors.
- Set, retrieve, and update elements in arrays and vectors.
- Loop through the elements of an array or vector using a standard loop and range-based for loops.
- Access, compare and manipulate container iterators.
- Loop through the container elements using iterators.
- Store and access text data using strings.
- Concatenate strings with other strings and with primitives.
- Extract, manipulate, and search for sub-strings.
- Pass containers to functions as parameters.
- Copy and compare containers.
- List other helpful C++ container classes and their Unreal Engine counterparts.
