# User Defined Types

Along with [the built-in primitive data types](/Programming-1-Notes/docs/05-introduction-to-cpp/03-data-types-variables-constants.html) we can also create our own data types in C++ using enumerations, structures, and classes.

## Objectives

Upon completion of this module, you should be able to:

- Define and use custom class enumerations.
- Define and use your own data structures with the `struct` keyword.
- Define your own classes and initialize objects based on these classes.
- Add custom constructors and destructors to your classes.
- Mark the member variables and functions in your classes as public, protected, or private.
- Add static member variables to your classes.
- Define classes that can be used to create `const` objects.
- Separate class definitions from their implementations using header files.
- Implement simple object-oriented inheritance with base and derived classes.
- Create overloaded operators for your custom classes.
