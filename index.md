# Programming 1

This is the first course in a two-part introduction to object-oriented programming and design in the context of graphics and sound programming. Assignments will pull from real-world game development problems with an emphasis on modern tooling and coding best practices.

## Course Outcomes

By the end of this course, using the C++ programming language, the student should be able to:

- Write and compile procedural and object-oriented programs.
- Design programs that make use of:
  - Standard library container classes.
  - I/O Streams and text formatting.
  - User defined types.
  - Functions and lambda expressions.
  - Custom object hierarchies using classes, inheritance and polymorphism.
- Debug complex error situations involving logical, compile-time, link-time, and run-time errors.
- Make use of 3rd party object-oriented graphics and sound libraries to solve game development problems.
